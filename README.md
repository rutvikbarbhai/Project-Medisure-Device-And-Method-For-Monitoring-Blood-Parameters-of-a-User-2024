# 🏥Project Medisure : Device & Method for Monitoring Blood Parameters of a User
## 🌍 Welcome to Project Medisure! 
### 💡 Prior Art
This initiative reflects our commitment to contributing meaningfully to the healthcare industry.
Over the past decade, non-invasive health monitoring has seen remarkable technological advancements, with numerous devices developed to improve patient comfort, usability, and the accuracy of health data. However, many existing solutions continue to face challenges, particularly in terms of long-term usability, patient compliance, and comprehensive health monitoring.
The proposed Medisure Care Plus device builds upon these existing systems, offering an innovative solution designed to overcome the shortcomings of current non-invasive monitoring technologies.
